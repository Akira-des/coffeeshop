<p align="center"> Café Noriter is a Korean-themed coffee shop that offers beverages, food, and ambiance.
 <br>From Korea, Noriter's concept was brought to the Philippines by a new proprietor and was successful in attracting the Filipino market.
 <br>The company's first branch was established in Dumaguete, followed by a second branch located in Taft Avenue, Manila.
 <br> Without a doubt, Café Noriter was triumphant in creating a place where customers can feel at home, enjoy a cup of coffee, relax, and have fun.
<br> It is also Cozy and ideal for studying. It has strong wifi, fair air conditioning and good lighting.
 <br>	We recommend oreo cheesecake and vanilla milkshake. 
 <br>Ideal to go here is around 5pm for there would be very few customers. 
 <br>And noticed that most of their visitors are couples so if you are okay with pda, this cafe is just fine.
 <br> Although our school is very far from Cafe Noriter, we still find ourselves a regular visitor of the cafe.
 <br> First introduced by a La Sallian friend, we we’re impressed with the cute and whimsical interior of the place.<br>
 Cafe Noriter is a Korean inspired café that can be found in Taft Avenue, Manila.
 <br> “Noriter” is the Korean term for playground, and indeed, this playhouse of a cafe is oozing with eccentricity and fun. 
 <br>Café Noriter emanates a very youthful vibe with all the quirky knick knacks displayed in their cupboards.
 <br>The place can also accommodate a large number of customers as they have lots of tables and seats. 
 <br>Some tables have some personal touches to them, as well. 
 <br> When visiting cafes, we always go for the ones with a comfy ambience.
 <br>It is a heavenly bonus when a cafe plays classical or jazz music (in that case, I’m in for a very productive night/ afternoon).
 <br> Cafe Noriter can accommodate large groups. 
 <br>The two-storey seats are perfect for those who want to have a homier feel because you get to sit on the floor: 
 <br>The wall decors such as installations and paintings also contribute to the airy atmosphere inside the café.
